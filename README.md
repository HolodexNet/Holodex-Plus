Holodex Companion Extension.

### [Changelog](https://github.com/HolodexNet/Holodex-Plus/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md)

### Local development (Chrome)

```bash
yarn
yarn dev # watch ts files

#in another pane
yarn dev:chrome # launch chrome
```

Hot refresh doesn't exist, but the files are watched and re-built when changed. To see your changes

- in `src/popup`, close and re-open the popup
- in `src/options`, reload the options page
- in `src/content`, reload the extension in [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions), then reload the page the content script is running in
- in `src/background`, reload the extension in [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions)

To open devtools for:

- `src/popup`, right-click the extension icon next to the address bar, and click `Inspect popup`
- `src/background`, go to [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions), then go to the extension's `Details`, then under `Inspect views`, click `background page`
- `src/options`, go to [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions), then go to the extension's `Details`, then click `Extension options`, which will open a new tab where you can open devtools normally
- `src/content`, open devtools on any page where the content script is running

### Local development (Firefox)

```bash
yarn
yarn dev # watch ts files

# in another pane
yarn dev:firefox # launch firefox
```

Reloading works the same way as in Chrome, but devtools works a bit differently from Chrome. `popup`, `background`, and `options` all output their content into the same inspection tool available through [about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox) -> `Inspect`.

Just like in Chrome, `options` can also be inspected normally by opening devtools on the options page, and content scripts output their logs into the opened page's devtools console.

You can inspect the sources of `popup` by opening the `Debugger` tab in the inspection tool, and selecting the source file on the left side.

### Publishing:

```bash
yarn dist
```

To build the published extension. The zip file will be put into the `dist/` folder.
